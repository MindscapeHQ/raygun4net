- Fixed Client.Name in Raygun4Net to fix group hasher breaking
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/551

### v11.1.2
- Fixed issue with SimpleJson where Uri/Guid couldn't be serialized.
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/546

### v11.1.1
- Prevented a null reference exception from being thrown after a PortableExecutable (PE) fails to be loaded from disk
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/544

### v11.1.0
- Fix issue with `RaygunClientBase` where `SendInBackground` deferred building the message until late, losing HttpContext
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/540
- Fix issue with `ThrottledBackgroundMessageProcessor` where it would hold up to 8 task threads even when idle
  - Task Workers are now created as needed and are disposed when not needed or idle
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/542

### v11.0.3
- Update `RaygunHttpModule` (Raygun4Net ASP.NET Framework) to use a singleton `RaygunClient` instance
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/537

### v11.0.2
- Fix null signature issue when Debug Symbols are set to None and the application is built in Release mode
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/535 

### v11.0.1
- Raygun4Net.NetCore
  - Deprecated `RaygunClientBase.Send()`. The asynchronous `SendAsync()` should be preferred in all scenarios to avoid potential deadlocks
  - Improve the potential deadlocks when calling `Send()` from a UI Thread by adding `ConfigureAwait(false)`
    - Note: This does not entirely remove the possibility of deadlocks, and `Send()` should not be used within a UI context

### v11.0.0
- Add support for PDB Debug Information in stack traces
  - This enables Raygun to leverage Portable PDBs to symbolicate .NET stack traces when PDBs are not included in the build output
  - This introduces a dependency on `System.Reflection.Metadata@6.0.1` for `netstandard`
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/528
- Add support for storing crash reports offline
  - There is a new `OfflineStore` property on `RaygunSettings`, when this is set, it will enable the offline storage
  - Crashes are stored offline when there is a connectivity issue, or when the Raygun remote server returns a 5xx response
  - There is a `IBackgroundSendStrategy`, which controls when to attempt to resend offline crash reports. It defaults to every 30 seconds
  - By default, there is a maximum of 50 offline crashes stored
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/530
- Removed marking an unhandled exception in Android as handled, preventing the app from crashing
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/531

### v10.1.2
- Fix issue where uncaught exceptions could sometimes not be reported to Raygun
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/529
  - Keeps a strong reference to the `OnApplicationUnhandledException` delegate in the client so that reference is alive as long as the client is

### v10.1.1
- Cleanup of the constructors for Net Core RaygunClient
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/525
- Reduce overhead of RaygunBreadcrumb
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/524 

### v10.1.0
- Add support for capturing Environment Variables in NetCore

  - Supports Exact, StartsWith, EndsWith, and Contains matching
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/523

### v10.0.0

  - Updated the usage of `.UseRaygun()`
  - Removed `RaygunMiddlewareSettings` and `RaygunClientProvider` in favour of `IRaygunUserProvider`
  - Removed custom code for maintaining request body in the middleware and used `Request.EnableBuffering()` instead

  - Deprecated `UserInfo` property in favour of `IRaygunUserProvider`
  - Deprecated `RaygunMiddlewareOptions` in favour of `RaygunSettings`
  - Introduced new `.AddRaygunUserProvider()` to register a default implementation
  - Introduced new `.AddRaygunUserProvider<T>()` to register a custom implementation
- Fixed bug with filters where uppercase properties were compared against lowercase filters
- Fixed null reference when accessing CustomData and Tags in RaygunMessage using OnSendingMessage
- Adds Breadcrumbs to NetCore and AspNetCore
  - See: https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4net/pull/516
  - Breadcrumbs are by default local to the asynchronous context using `AsyncLocalBreadcrumbStorage`
  - Additional `InMemmoryBreadcrumbStorage` implemented for global context breadcrumbs

### v9.0.4

### v9.0.2
